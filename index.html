        <h1><b>Lake Merritt 311 Service Requests</b></h1>
        <p>Has Lake Merritt really gone to hell since the COVID-19 pandemic began?</p>

    <p>Oakland's "Crown Jewel," Lake Merritt, is home to the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/lake-merritt-bird-islands-oakland" target="_blank">oldest 
       wildlife refuge in the US</a>, the <a href="https://www.owrcrowers.org/" target="_blank">oldest ongoing women's 
       whaleboat rowing club in the US</a>, a <a href="https://www.lakemerritt.org/recreation.html" target="_blank">variety of  
       recreational clubs</a>, and <a href="https://www.lakemerritt.org/gardens.html" target="_blank">several gardens</a>.  
       It's now also home to <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/04/04/covid-oakland-officials-cracking-down-weekend-crowds-lake-merritt/" 
       target="_blank">frustrated residents</a> who have complained throughout the pandemic that increased crowds 
       have led to what they claim are more traffic snarls, vandalism, littering, and dumping around the lake and in the nearby neighborhoods.
        In this project I examine 311 service requests made in the Lake Merritt Area both before and during the pandemic 
        to examine which, if any, types of complaints have in fact increased from pred-pandemic levels.
