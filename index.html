                    The data was obtained from the <a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/services/oak311" target="_blank">City of Oakland's 311 request system</a>, which 
                    allows members of the public to report issues like graffiti, illegal dumping, and damaged infrastructure to the city via phone call, a web form, or phone apps. 
                    The data is <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.oaklandca.gov/quth-gb8e" target="_blank">publicly available</a>, was retrieved using the 
                    the python client for the Socrata Open Data API, <a href="https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy" target="_blank">sodapy</a>.  I then cleaned the data in
                    python using the pandas module, starting by removing requests with 'canceled' status, 
                    which included all requests that were accidentally filed, tests of the system, or were requests that the city had determined were duplicates of existing 
                    requests.   Using module geopandas, the datapoints were then clipped to a polygon that included the lake, the parks that flank the lake, and
                    a swathe of the adjacent neighborhood approximately 500 meters deep, which was generated using 
                    <a href="http://arthur-e.github.io/Wicket/sandbox-gmaps3.html" target="_blank">Wicket</a>.  
                    Lastly, I manually reviewed the nearly 400 unique request descriptions found in the data, mapped them to one of six categories ("illegal dumping", 
                    "litter", "graffiti", "illegal parking", "street maintenance", or "not targeted"), and limited the data to the five categories of interest.

                    <p>To start my exploration, I compared overall request volume for 
                        each of my 5 categories of interest for the first year of the pandemic 
                        (the "pandemic" period, covering March 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021) and the 
                        year immediately preceding it (the "pre-pandemic" period, covering March 1, 2019 
                        through February 29, 2020). Looking at the bar chart to the right, we can see that 
                        while some categories of requests did in fact increase in volume in the pandemic 
                        period from their levels in the pre-pandemic year, volumes for two categories 
                        actually <em>decreased</em> during the pandemic period.

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Looking at dumping, we see the most significant increase of any of the categories, 
                        with a 25.5% increase in the pandemic period request volume from the pre-pandemic one. 
                        This seems like a large increase, and looking at the table below we see that it is 
                        in fact unusually high compared to the percent-change seen in the preceding years.

                    <p>Looking at graffiti we see a very different situation.  First of all, the pandemic period request volume <em>decreased</em> 
                       from that of the pre-pandemic period.  Further, while the 18.3% change may initially seem large, looking  
                       at the historical data in the table below we see that this percent-change is actually the smallest seen in years. 
                    As a result, while there was a change in volume, it doesn't seem at all unusual.</p>

                    <p>Looking at monthly dumping request volume across the year for years 2016 through 2020, 
                        we see that for most of 2020 monthly volumes for most of the year are actually similar 
                        to previous years.  The August-October 2020 period is the exception, where a large peak 
                        occurs.  If you this peak to those of the other categories in the following charts 
                        (particularly that of littering requests), you will notice that the timing of this peak is different.

                    <p>Looking at graffiti request volume across the year for 2016 through 2020, we see that 
                        graffiti requests were low and stable for most of the year, increasing slightly in 
                        the fall before dropping again in December.  The pattern seems tame in comparison to 
                        the large spring-time peak seen in 2016.

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Looking at street maintenance requests we see a small peak in February 2020, however this 
                        may not have been a peak if there weren't such a drammatic drop in requests in the months that 
                        followed. The report volume decreased drammatically in March 2020, the same month that Alameda 
                        County's shelter-in-place order for COVID-19 went in to effect, before gradually ticking upwards 
                        throughout the year.  This drop in particular makes me wonder if there was actually  
                        a decrease in problems in the streets, lights, and signs, or just fewer people motivated to 
                        report those problems encountering them because fewer people were commuting.

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Looking at illegal parking requests, we see that the these requests started lower in monthly volume 
                        at the beginning of 2020 than they did in 2019, but peaked slightly higher in 2020, and mostly remained  
                        higher in 2020 through the fall.  In both years these requests peak in the summer months, 
                        when the lake is most popular. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="step last-child">
                    <p>Looking at litter, we see that the highest peak comes in May 2020, 
                        and the volumes that year decline through the summer and increasing again in the fall. The 
                        pattern through the spring and summer is generally similar to that of requests in 2019, but 
                        falls more drammatically in July through September 2020 (about the time period that the state and 
                        county were experiencing a worrying increase in COVID-19 cases), and increases in October and 
                        November during the drop in state and county COVID-19 cases between the summer and winter peaks 
                        (see this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/alameda-california-covid-cases.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> data 
                        for county details).  
                        This makes me think that litter requests, in particular, best reflect the number of visitors 
                        to Lake Merritt.

                    In addition to the presence or lack of issues being reported, I wondered if the city's slow response to 
                    requests might also be part of the situation frustrating residents.  Looking at the violin plots 
                    showing the distributions of the numbers of days it took the city to close requests of the five 
                    targeted types for requests in 2016 through 2020, we see that slow action by the city might in fact 
                    be part of the frustration.  While requests for illegal dumping have a mean of only 4.4 days and an 
                    inter-quartile range (IQR) of only 3 days, requests for litter have a mean of 23.1 days and and 
                    IQR of 23 days.

                    request categories.  Toggling between the heatmaps of different categories you will notice 
                    that different issues show very different distribution patterns around the lake.  For example, 
                    street maintenance requests are concentrated around intersections, while illegal dumping requests 
                    are more spread along the length of roads.  And while illegal dumping is seen intensely in 
                    residential areas (note the relative lack of dumping requests in the Financial District on 
                    the upper-left side of the lake), graffiti requests are more frequent in public areas like 
                    parks and the area around the Alameda County Administrative Building.

            <div class="textblock">
                <p>From the data it does appear that the pandemic has in fact had an effect of a number of the issues that 
                    have been cited by residents of the Lake Merritt area as problematic.  However, not all of those changes 
                    constituted an <em>increase</em> in problems.  For example, while there were significant increases in 
                    requests to address illegal dumping and littering, there was also a spectacular decrease in 
                    requests for street maintenance.  Further, given that the various issues have had very different peaks in 
                    2020, I suspect that they aren't all driven by the same human activity.  For example, while I think the 
                    litter is likely to be produced by the visitors to the lake and the surrounding area (and perhaps compouned
                     by the city's slow response to reports of it), dumping is more likely produced by residents of the area themselves, 
                     rather than by visitors.  
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, the data here is limited. Other data, in particular incident data from the Oakland Police Department, probably 
                    could have provided more insight on traffic issues and illegal activities like illegal fireworks, crime, 
                    and noise ordinance violations.  These are all issues that the area residents have pointed to as problematic, but 
                    simply are not reflected in the 311 requests.  Unfortunately, OPD incident data is only available in its unaggregated form 
                    for the last 90 days, and so it was not possible to do an analysis comparing incident data to pre-pandemic levels, or to
                    examine the data across the course of the pandemic.
